TODO model description

### Physical Model

There is no air resistance, so the paths traversed by the projectiles are perfect parabolas. That also means they can
be computed analytically. So Projectiles are characterized by their initial position, angle and velocity, and time 
airborne.

### Statistical Model

Each random distribution is generated by a Gaussian. Note that when multiple Gaussian sources are combined, the result is 
not necessarily Gaussian.
